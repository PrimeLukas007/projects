# Should I open my window?
In config.json you need to set your lat, long, timezone and you ideal temperature.
After you do that you need to run the python script, after you do a tkinter window ill pop up, there you will enter the temperature that you have in your room at the moment and my code will tell you if you should open your window depending on you ideal temperature.

Do not put anything but the number into the configs / tkinter
